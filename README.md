# SliServer
Python server to send and receive data to and from EPICS, and do data fits on a diffraction pattern. 

Main entry point is SliServer.py

The ioc directory contains a very simple EPICS database, that the server will use to push and collect information from. 

The data directory contains simulation files that are used to test SliData.py and test functionality of fitting.
